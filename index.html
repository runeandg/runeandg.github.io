abstract: I am a passionate and dedicated programmer with a solid foundation in algorithms and problem-solving. My journey began many years ago at the ripe age of 12 when I wanted to create my own custom boss in the game World of Warcraft. Recently I started the Programming 1 course, where I honed my skills in foundational programming concepts and practical applications. Along the way, I have also tackled various challenges on LeetCode, building a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms. <br> </br>Recently, I applied my knowledge of matrix manipulation through a Hill Cipher assignment, where I explored how linear algebra concepts can be used in encryption and decryption processes. This project deepened my understanding of matrix operations and their practical applications, reflecting my growing proficiency in mathematical problem-solving.

<p class="Section">&ensp;<a href="about.html">About me</a></p>
    <p class="BodyText Justified">I am a 29-year-old student pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering (BIDATA) at NTNU in
        Ålesund. Alongside my technical studies, I hold a Master's in Education (M. Ed.) from Høgskulen i Volda, where
        my thesis explored how teachers in secondary schools use formative feedback in mathematics. My academic
        background combines a strong passion for both technology and education, giving me a unique perspective on
        problem-solving and learning methodologies.

<p class="SubSection">1 &ensp; Ongoing Projects</p>

<p class="BodyText Justified"> 1.1 - <a href="computerarchitecture.html">Computer Architecture</a>: A project with focus
    on teamwork and how to use agile project management frameworks.
    </p>

<p class="BodyText Justified"> 1.2 - <a href="fll.html">First Lego League</a>: A project focusing on evolving from the
    prior project and coding in Python.
</p>

<p class="BodyText Justified"> 1.3 - <a href="portfolio_assignment.html">Programming 1 Portfolio Assignment</a>: Our exam
for IDATA1003, where we are to create an application that attempts to help the end user find good solutions to manage
    their own food waste </p>

<p class="SubSection">2 &ensp; Skills</p>
<p class="BodyText Justified"> I have dabbled in various technologies to broaden my programming skill set, including RESTful APIs,
    PostgreSQL for database management, and Postman for testing and debugging API endpoints. Additionally, I have explored
    Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to build and deploy web applications. This portfolio itself was developed
    using Ruby and Jekyll, locally hosted for customization, and I utilize Git for version control to track changes and
    maintain a structured development workflow. These tools have given me hands-on experience in backend development,
    web hosting, and API integration, complementing my broader interest in software engineering. In addition to this,
    to enhance my technical skills and align with industry standards, I have been using Linux as the primary operating system
    on my laptop. This decision was motivated by its prevalence amongst my peers and its extensive use in the fields of
    software development.
