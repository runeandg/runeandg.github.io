title: First Lego League
---

<p class="BodyText Justified"> Our work on the First Lego League project is now in its final stages.
    We have conducted a thorough task analysis to outline the project's requirements and goals. Building on the
    teamwork insights gained from our previous computer architecture project, we aim to enhance collaboration and
    efficiency within our team. By applying lessons learned in areas such as task delegation, communication, and the
    use of frameworks like Kanban, we are laying a strong foundation for successful project execution. What separates
    this project from the computer architecture is our better delegation of tasks and more process-oriented work strategy.
    Through this project we have gotten to know eachother's strengths and learned to depend on eachother.

<p class="BodyText Justified"> One of the core learning outcomes of this project has been the adaptability and flexibility
    that is required to do development work - while all our members have experienced team work before, not exactly in this
    kind of development environment. This, in conjunction with our lecturer's explanation of agile methods vs waterfall methodology.
