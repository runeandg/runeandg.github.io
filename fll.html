title: First Lego League
---

<p class="BodyText Justified"> Our work on the First Lego League project is still in the preparatory stages,
    where we have conducted a thorough task analysis to outline the project's requirements and goals. Building on the
    teamwork insights gained from our previous computer architecture project, we aim to enhance collaboration and
    efficiency within our team. By applying lessons learned in areas such as task delegation, communication, and the
    use of frameworks like Kanban, we are laying a strong foundation for successful project execution. This approach
    will guide us as we move from planning to hands-on development in the coming phases.
