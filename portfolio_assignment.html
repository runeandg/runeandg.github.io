title: Portfolio Assignment
---
<p class="BodyText Justified"> As part of my Programming 1 course, I am
    working on a portfolio assessment which is a formative process consisting of process work submitted in stages leading up to the
    final deadline. This project includes both a detailed report and a functional coding application.
</p>

<p class="BodyText Justified"> For this assignment, we are tasked with creating an application that tracks food
    expiration dates in a personal food storage unit. The application notifies users when items are nearing their
    expiration date and suggests recipes based on these ingredients. A key focus in this course is on ensuring
    strong cohesion and proper abstraction within our code, which means designing modular, well-organized components
    that are both efficient and maintainable. This project provides a practical context for applying these principles,
    allowing me to develop real-world programming skills while ensuring clean, organized code structure.
