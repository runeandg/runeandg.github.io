title: About me
---

<p class="BodyText Justified">My passion for technology was sparked early by a love for video games, particularly MMORPGs
    like World of Warcraft. In addition to playing, I’ve developed a strong interest in the technical aspects of
    gaming. As a dedicated raider, I enjoy guiding groups through complex in-game mechanics, where strategy and
    collaboration are essential to success. This experience parallels my academic background, including my Master's
    in Education, where I focused on how formative feedback enhances learning. In both contexts, I’ve found that
    thoughtful guidance and teamwork lead to better outcomes, whether in the classroom or in a challenging raid.
    I hope to one day contribute to theorycrafting and simulationcraft projects, applying both my technical
    knowledge and educational insights to help others succeed.

<p class="BodyText Justified">My enthusiasm for mathematics has been a constant throughout my academic journey.
    Whether it’s exploring cryptographic algorithms or delving into the theoretical aspects of programming,
    math has always been at the core of my learning and problem-solving. This passion is also reflected in the
    design of my portfolio, which is built around LaTeX—a typesetting system widely used in academic and mathematical
    communities. LaTeX not only allows me to present complex mathematical concepts with precision but also represents
    my appreciation for structure and clarity in both math and programming.
