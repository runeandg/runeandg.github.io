title: Computer architecture
---

<p class="BodyText Justified">The objective of the computer architecture project extended beyond technical development;
    it focused on understanding team dynamics and fostering effective collaboration using frameworks like Scrum and Kanban.
    Our team employed Kanban-inspired techniques through GitLab's issue board, accompanied by weekly stand-up meetings to ensure
    progress and accountability. We also leveraged Discord for real-time communication and coordination as needed.
